## 📁 **FOLDER BREAKDOWN**

You have TWO folders in `C:\Users\Raja\Desktop\Projects\NewCkan\`:

### 1️⃣ **`ckan/` Folder**
- **Purpose**: This is the official CKAN source code repository
- **Status**: ❌ **NOT RUNNING** (just source code)
- **What it contains**:
  - Original CKAN source code from GitHub
  - Used for reference only
  - We cloned this initially but didn't use it

### 2️⃣ **`ckan-docker/` Folder** ✅
- **Purpose**: Docker Compose setup for CKAN
- **Status**: ✅ **RUNNING AND WORKING!**
- **What it contains**:
  - `docker-compose.yml` - Container orchestration
  - `Dockerfile.custom` - Custom image with your theme
  - `custom-theme/` - Your custom theme extension
  - `.env` - Environment configuration

---

## ❓ **WHY TWO FOLDERS?**

### What Happened:
1. Initially cloned the CKAN source code to `ckan/` (for reference)
2. Then cloned the Docker Compose setup to `ckan-docker/` (the actual working installation)
3. Built custom theme in `ckan-docker/custom-theme/`
4. Created custom Docker image in `ckan-docker/Dockerfile.custom`

### What You Need:
**Only `ckan-docker/` is needed!** ✅

You can safely **delete the `ckan/` folder** if you want to clean up - it's not being used.

---

## 🎯 **SUMMARY**

| Folder | Status | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `ckan/` | ❌ Not used | CKAN source code (reference only) |
| `ckan-docker/` | ✅ **RUNNING** | **Your working CKAN installation** |

### The Answer:
**`ckan-docker` is the one that's running and worked!** ✅

---

## 💡 **WHAT TO TELL YOUR MANAGER**

*"The working CKAN installation is in the `ckan-docker` folder. This contains the Docker Compose setup with our custom theme built into the Docker image. All services are running healthy and the custom theme is live at https://localhost:8443"*

**🎉 You're working with `ckan-docker/` - that's your production-ready setup!** ✅
